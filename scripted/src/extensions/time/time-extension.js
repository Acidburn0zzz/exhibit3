/**
 * @fileOverview An extension to Exhibit adding a view using SIMILE Timeline.

/**
 * This extension is subject to ugly, ugly hacks because Timeline a) relies
 * on SimileAjax, which Exhibit 3.0 no longer does, and b) Timeline's method
 * of loading (via SimileAjax) is outdated and not compatible with Exhibit.
 *
 * In order to compensate, this file uses one polling loop and a modified
 * version of the SimileAjax loader.  The polling loop waits until Timeline
 * has loaded and is defined in the window context.  The extension must take
 * advantage of Exhibit's delay mechanism so Exhibit will delay creation
 * until Timeline has finished loading.  The modified SimileAjax loader does
 * not load SimileAjax jQuery or allow SimileAjax to modify jQuery but has to
 * define some of the material in SimileAjax as a consequence.  See
 * load-simile-ajax.js.
